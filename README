== RailsJazz.com website sources. 

I think this project could be good sample of usage Rails 3 with HAML/SASS on Heroku.

Main technologies: Rails 3.0.3, HAML/SASS, Paperclip, Inherited Resources.

Please note that you need to set ENV variables

S3_KEY              => amazon_s3_key
S3_SECRET           => amazon_s3_secret
USER_NAME           => login_to_admin
USER_PASSWORD       => password_to_admin

Next you can login to admin section on http://localhost:3000/admin.
